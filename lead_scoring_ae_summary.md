## Lead Scoring Cheat Sheet for Discovery Calls

### ✅ Questions to Validate High Scores

**If score shows high growth signals, ask:**
- "I see you're broadcasting on [channels]. How is that content strategy working for you?"
- "With [X] monthly listeners, what are your biggest challenges in scaling?"
- "What are your top priorities for growth this year?"

**If score shows buying intent, ask:**
- "I noticed you [attended event/completed meeting/downloaded resource]. What specifically prompted you to explore solutions now?"
- "You mentioned [timeline]. What's driving that deadline?"

**If score shows budget authority, confirm:**
- "What does your decision-making process look like for new technology?"
- "Have you allocated budget for ministry operations improvements this year?"

### 🚩 Red Flags to Address

| Score Signal | What It Means | How to Handle |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Negative score | Competitor, wrong fit, or opt-out | Disqualify immediately unless data error |
| Low score (0-99) with inbound inquiry | Curious but not qualified | Quick qualification call, then nurture |
| High fit score but low engagement | Right profile, wrong timing | Schedule 6-month follow-up |
| High engagement but low fit | Interested but can't use product | Politely disqualify, suggest alternatives |

## How Scores Are Built

**Your lead score = FIT + ENGAGEMENT**

- **Fit Score** = Company characteristics (size, type, revenue, staff)
- **Engagement Score** = Actions taken (emails, meetings, forms, events)

**Example Hot Lead (1,500+ points):**
- Church with 800 attendance (+10)
- $8M annual revenue (+10)
- 75 employees (+10)
- Broadcasting on TV & radio (+20)
- 50K monthly listeners (+10)
- Using CRM tools (+5)
- Attended marketing event (+50)
- Completed meeting (+50)
- Replied to sales email (+15)
- Timeline: 1-3 months (+50)
- Budget: $2M+ (+20)
- Decision maker engaged (+20)
- **Total: 270+ points from shown criteria alone**

**Example Disqualified Lead (-75 points):**
- Competitor (-5)
- Under $1M revenue (-5)
- Under 10 employees (-5)
- No distribution channels (-10)
- Just planning content strategy (-10)
- Not looking to grow (-50)
- **Total: -85 points**

## Quick Prioritization Workflow

### Monday Morning Routine
1. **Filter HubSpot for scores 1,000+** → Call/email same day
2. **Review scores 500-999** → Schedule outreach for week
3. **Check recent score increases** → Someone just took action, strike while hot

### When a Lead Jumps Score Bands
- **+200 points in 24 hours** = Something happened (event, email reply, form) → Call immediately
- **Crossed 500 threshold** = Moved from cold to warm → Time to engage
- **Crossed 1,000 threshold** = Ready to buy → This is your next close

### Before Every Call
1. Review the score breakdown in HubSpot
2. Identify which signals drove the score
3. Prepare questions around those signals
4. Note any negative scores to address concerns

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my lead scored high but not responding?**
**A:** High fit score ≠ high engagement. They match our ICP but haven't shown buying intent yet. Use the fit signals to personalize outreach about their specific situation.

**Q: Lead has low score but is asking for demo. What do I do?**
**A:** Take the meeting! Score is predictive, not absolute. Quick qualification to confirm they're not disqualified, then proceed. Update qualification fields to boost score.

**Q: Score seems wrong. Can I override it?**
**A:** Contact Growth Ops to review. Score is based on data in HubSpot, so might indicate missing information rather than wrong score.

**Q: How often do scores update?**
**A:** Real-time as data changes. When someone opens an email, submits a form, or you update their record, score adjusts immediately.

**Q: What score should I expect to close?**
**A:** 500+ at engagement, 1,000+ at proposal stage. If proposing to sub-500 lead, qualification might be weak.
